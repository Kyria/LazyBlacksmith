# LazyBlacksmith

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/4d87ed6e0392407bb442abfc1fc2f12e)](https://www.codacy.com/app/Kyria/LazyBlacksmith?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Kyria/LazyBlacksmith&utm_campaign=badger)

An EVE Online Industry application for lazy people.


## About
LazyBlacksmith is a flask application allowing people to get informations about industry in eveonline.

#### Features
* Blueprints
 * Manufacturing informations including components required and installation costs
 * Research data for material and time efficiency (time, cost)
 * Invention informations for components and costs.
* Get and compare item price over all regions

#### CREST (as batch or through celery)
* Use CREST market price / adjusted price for costs
* Use CREST industry index for installation fee

#### TODO
* Ore refining and compression (see branch ore_refining_compression)
 * View refining table
 * Calculate compression from user needs (in materials) and using defaults ore
  * Also allow to manually select what ore we want to use to compress
* Permalinks in manufacturing / research / production
* Link API key to user account (CREST Login) to get, save and configure existing blueprints, with their ME/TE for direct use in manufacturing / invention



## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* Virtualenv (recommended)
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) + [Grunt-CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
* Database connectors depending on the one you use (MySQL 5.6+,...)
* See [requirements.txt](requirements/) for other requirements
* (Optional/Recommended) Cache system (eg. python-memcached or redis-cache)
* (Optional) [Redis](http://redis.io/) for async tasks and queues (and cache)!
* Eve Online Icons (see CCP Icons part)



## Installation

#### Environnement
Create your virtualenv and get LazyBlacksmith.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Kyria/LazyBlacksmith.git
cd LazyBlacksmith
virtualenv env
```

Once your virtualenv is created, load it and install requirements
```
# in windows, type env/Script/activate
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt

# if you are using celery with redis
pip install -r requirements/requirements-celery-redis.txt
```

#### Configs
You now need to create an application on [EVE Online Developpers](https://developers.eveonline.com/applications) to get CREST informations (secret key, client ID)

Once this is done, copy config.dist into config.py and edit the file.
Some mandatory informations :
```
DEBUG : True for dev, False for prod (require static compilation, see below)
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI : the database informations
USE_CCP_ICONS : True/False to display icons (read the CCP Icons chapter below)
CACHE_TYPE : leave 'null' if no cache, or set it your needs

Celery configs, if you don't use it, leave them like that

CREST API informations : set it with what you got/set before in CCP Developpers Application
```

#### Init data
Now you set everything, it's time to "install" the database. This should create all the table in your database (if you get any errors, check you sqlalchemy informations)
```
python manage.py db upgrade
```

Download the latest SDE conversion from fuzzwork in sqlite [here](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/sqlite-latest.sqlite.bz2) unzip it then load it with :
```
python manage.py sde_import -d path/to/sqlite-latest.sqlite
```

If you also want to have some CREST data right now, you can run the following commands :
```
python manage.py celery_task -a update_adjusted_price
python manage.py celery_task -a update_industry_index
python manage.py celery_task -a update_market_price
```

#### Static file compilation
If you are using it in production environnement, or upgrading your installation, you need to remake all static files (css/js). For this, first do ```npm install``` to install all the nodejs required package, then type ```grunt``` to compile the static files.

#### CREST / API
To update the CREST data, you have 2 solutions :
* run them directly, as you did in the "init data" part
* use celery

##### Celery + Celery Beat (Scheduler)
There are multiple solution to run celery with celery beat. The example below are the minimal configurations.

You can celery with the -B option, to run beat and worker in the same time :
```
PATH/TO/LazyBlacksmith/env/bin/celery worker -A celery_app:celery_app -B -c5
```

Or you can run two daemons, one for celery beat, the other for the workers :
```
# celery beat
PATH/TO/LazyBlacksmith/env/bin/celery beat -A celery_app:celery_app

# celery workers
PATH/TO/LazyBlacksmith/env/bin/celery multi start worker -A celery_app:celery_app -c5
```



## CCP Icons

If you set ```USE_CCP_ICONS = True``` you need to download the files "EVE_VERSION_Types.zip" from CCP Toolkit ; https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources and then
move the files into ```lazyblacksmith/static/ccp/``` (as a result, you should have ```lazyblacksmith/static/ccp/Types/files.png```)
